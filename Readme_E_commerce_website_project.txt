* the URL of the functioning website to match code against is: 
* http://lolin01.nvcc.edu/student215/Business_Project_Final/index.php

* To best experiment with website at the link, start with registering with the website
* at the Registration link under the 'E-Store' drop down menu on top menu bar.
* After sucessful registration, go to the 'login' link under 'E-store' menu
* to login on website. After logging in, you can make purchases at the catalog.
* The shopping cart updates and maintains itself over the user session.
* After clicking the checkout link or button you should get a receipt.
* (Note: you don't actually purchase anything since this is an experimental
*        E-commerce website to test functionability)

* Also,after logging in, the feedback link can be used to 'send' feedback
* to company and the feedback output can be copied and send to user's email

* Last, many pages with only text are there for show to help mimic an E-commerce website.
