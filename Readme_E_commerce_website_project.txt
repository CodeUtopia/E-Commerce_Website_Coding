*Program and Code by Sattyik Kundu
  
* Enclosed is the codes for my E-commerce Website which centers on selling Art Supplies.

* the URL of the functioning website to match the code against is: 
* http://lolin01.nvcc.edu/student215/Business_Project_Final/index.php

* To best experiment with website at the link, start with registering with the website
* at the Registration link under the 'E-Store' drop down menu on top menu bar.
* (Note: if you want to skip registering, you can dive into the website with
*     username: Holon 
*     password: Matrix
*  )

* After sucessful registration, go to the 'login' link under 'E-store' menu
* to login on website (Note: you can tell if you are logged in or not by seeing 
*     to the top right of website asking you to login or log out; you 
*	  also get sent to a page that tells you of your login status)

* After logging in, you can make purchases at the catalog.
* The shopping cart updates and maintains itself over the user session.
* After clicking the checkout link or button you should get a receipt.
* (Note: you don't actually purchase anything since this is an experimental
*        E-commerce website to test functionability)

* Also,after logging in, the feedback link can be used to 'send' feedback
* to company and the feedback output can be copied and send to user's email

* Many other pages with only text are there for show to help mimic an E-commerce website. 
*Lastly, if you make any errors at any of the input forms in the website, there are validation
*javascript codes which tell you what the input error was.
